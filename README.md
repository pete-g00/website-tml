# Turing Machine Language

This is the repo for the Turing Machine Language website. The website can be found [here](https://pete-g00.github.io/website-tml/).

Current TODOs:

- Move the non-homepage pages to gitbook
- Update the errors from TML v1 to TML v2
- Ensure that tape execution is rendered correctly (animations and values are correct)
- Write useful tests
