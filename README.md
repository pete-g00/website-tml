# Turing Machine Language

This is the repo for the Turing Machine Language website. The website can be found [here](https://pete-g00.github.io/website-tml/).

Current TODOs:

- Complete the documentation
- Create error pages in the documentation
- Ensure that tape execution is rendered correctly (animations and values are correct)
- Fix the tape animation (possibly because of multiple dispatches fired at the same time)
- Write useful tests
