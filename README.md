# Turing Machine Language

This is the repo for the Turing Machine Language website. The website can be found [here](https://pete-g00.github.io/website-tml/). The documentation can be found [here](https://pete00g.gitbook.io/turing-machine-language/).

At this point, the website should be working correctly. There are a bunch of bugs with the animation that I'm currently working on. Create an issue if something doesn't work as expected!

<!-- 

- Fix the tape/editor position animation (possibly because of multiple dispatches fired at the same time)
- Fix the TM text colour (white for dark background; black for light background)
- Fix the TM highlight colour (blue for light background; ? for dark background)
- Fix the resizing re-render
- Write useful tests 

-->
